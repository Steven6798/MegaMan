DefinitelyNotMegaMan Programming Assignment
Disclaimer:
I don't own any asset currently in the program.
This project is for my personal use in practicing my 
programming knowledge and having some fun along the way.

Glitches found
Music from previous levels doesn't start or stop after level 1

TODO
Adjust level requirements (asteroidsToDestroy)
Make a level have multiple asteroids
Have fun

Observations
Program is very CPU heavy, takes more up as levels increase. Inefficient program?
