# Project 1 - Definitely Not Megaman
	Small project description	
	
		This program is the branching development of a prototype project given to us to work 		on. The game takes a light-hearted tone and is made to be a fun experience, but can be 		difficult to some people in later levels. It is not so much a monotone experience as 		it is a blend of the creativity of the two programmers. See if you can discern who did 		what.
	
	Estimated Time spent: 50 Hours.

## Notes

	What was your project's biggest challenge? 
		Our project's biggest challenge was to decide the best algorithms for the logic 		problems. It was also difficult to learn how the methods and classes intertwined so we 		could create new things from them.
	
    What was your favorite part of the project?
    	Our favorite part of the project was learning how to work on multiples classes at the 		same time and to control an object with keys. It was also fun to create some of the 		more comical elements in the levels and seeing it work.
