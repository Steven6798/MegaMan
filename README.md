DefinitelyNotMegaMan Programming Assignment
Disclaimer:
I don't own any asset currently in the program.
This project is for my personal use in practicing my 
programming knowledge and having some fun along the way.

TODO
Glitches found
Music from previous levels doesn't stop
Bullets now shoot a bit higher than gun, fix it's location
Fix staying turned left

Observations
Program is very CPU heavy, takes more up as levels increase. Inefficient program?
